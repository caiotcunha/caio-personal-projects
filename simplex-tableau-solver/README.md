## Simplex Tableau Solver (Python)

This project implements the Simplex method for solving linear programming problems. It provides a tableau class that builds the simplex tableau, adds slack variables, performs pivot operations, and detects optimal, unbounded, or infeasible solutions â€” producing the final solution vector and objective value. The implementation is written in Python using NumPy, reads problem data from standard input, and prints formatted results (including handling of "otima", "ilimitada", and "inviavel" cases). See the code in main.py for details.
