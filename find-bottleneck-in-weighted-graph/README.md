## Find bottleneck in weighted graph
This project was developed as part of a course in Algorithms and Data Structures. It allowed me to practice implementing common data structures and gain a deeper understanding of their functionality. In this work, I was challenged to design a solution for a problem proposed by the instructor, which I modeled using a weighted graph.
